VERSION = '1.3.2'

# First, let's set up the constants that we'll need to signify the state of the `deferred` object. These will be returned from the `state()` method.

PENDING = "pending"
RESOLVED = "resolved"
REJECTED = "rejected"

# `has` and `isArguments` are both workarounds for JS quirks. We use them only to flatten arrays. 

# `has` checks if an object natively owns a particular property, 
has = (obj, prop) -> obj?.hasOwnProperty prop
# while `isArguments` checks if the given object is a method arguments object (like an array, but not quite).
isArguments = (obj) -> return has(obj, 'length') and has(obj, 'callee')

# Borrowed from the incredibly useful [underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/), these three utilities help 
# flatten argument arrays,
flatten = (array) ->
  return flatten Array.prototype.slice.call(array) if isArguments array
  return [array] if not Array.isArray array
  # > `reduce` requires a modern JS interpreter, or a shim.
  return array.reduce (memo, value) ->    
    return memo.concat flatten value if Array.isArray(value)
    memo.push value
    return memo
  , []

# call functions only after they've been invoked a certain number of times, 
after = (times, func) ->
  return func() if times <= 0
  return -> func.apply(this, arguments) if --times < 1

# and wrap functions so we can run code before and after execution.
wrap = (func, wrapper) ->
  return ->
    args = [func].concat Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0)
    wrapper.apply this, args

# Now we'll need a general callback executor, with optional control over the execution context.
execute = (callbacks, args, context) -> callback.call(context, args...) for callback in flatten callbacks

# Let's start with the Deferred object constructor - it needs no arguments 
Deferred = ->
  # and all `deferred` objects are in a `'pending'` state when initialized.
  state = PENDING
  doneCallbacks = []
  failCallbacks = []
  alwaysCallbacks = []
  closingArguments = {}
  # Calling `.promise()` gives you an object that you pass around your code indiscriminately. 
  # Any code can add callbacks to a `promise`, but none can alter the state of the `deferred` itself. 
  # You can also transform any candidate object into a promise for this particular deferred object by passing it in.
  @promise = (candidate) ->
    candidate = candidate || {}
    # `.state()` returns the state of the current deferred object. This will be one of `'pending'`, `'resolved'` or `'rejected'`.

    # Let's now create a mechanism to store the callbacks that are added in, or execute them immediately if the deferred has already been resolved or rejected.
    storeCallbacks = (shouldExecuteImmediately, holder) ->

        if state is PENDING then holder.push (flatten arguments)...

        return candidate
    # Now we can add success / resolution callbacks using `.done(callback)`,
    candidate.done = storeCallbacks((-> state is RESOLVED), doneCallbacks)
    # or failure callbacks using `.fail(callback)`,
    candidate.fail = storeCallbacks((-> state is REJECTED), failCallbacks)
    # or register a callback to always fire when the deferred is either resolved or rejected - using `.always(callback)`
    candidate.always = storeCallbacks((-> state isnt PENDING), alwaysCallbacks)

    # It also makes sense to set up a piper to which can filter the success or failure arguments through the given filter methods. 
    # Quite useful if you want to transform the results of a promise or log them in some way. 
    pipe = (doneFilter, failFilter) ->

  # Moving to the methods that exist only on the deferred object itself, 
  # let's create a generic closing function that stores the final resolution / rejection arguments for future callbacks;
  # and then runs all the callbacks that have already been set. 
  close = (finalState, callbacks, context) ->

        state = finalState
        closingArguments = arguments
        execute [callbacks, alwaysCallbacks], closingArguments, context
      return this
  # Now we can set up `.resolve([args])` method to close the deferred and call the `done` callbacks,
  @resolve = close RESOLVED, doneCallbacks
  # and `.reject([args])` to fail it and call the `fail` callbacks.
  @reject = close REJECTED, failCallbacks
  # We can also set up `.resolveWith(context, [args])` and `.rejectWith(context, [args])` to allow setting an execution scope for the callbacks.

# If we're dealing with multiple deferreds, it would be nifty to have a way to run code after all of them succeed (or any of them fail).
