# Widgets

[Widgets](http://silverstripe.org/widgets) are small pieces of functionality such as showing the latest Comments or Flickr Photos. Since SilverStripe 3.0, they have been moved into a standalone module at [github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-widgets](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-widgets).
